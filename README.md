# wo

I write a lot of code, but sometimes I forget where it is and when to use it.

This tool is intended to be a companion for facilitating the generation of a context when I execute tasks.

It's also a central hub for executing computer operations.

Some contexts include:

- Coding in a particular repository
- Using a particular application

## TODO

- Integrate `*mgr` tools

Per repository:

- Tools to manage config
- Launch/change vscode profiles
